# Game Config Switcher (GCS)
## Copy game config file profiles using UI or CLI

Some games fail to automatically adjust the monitor in-game resolution to the correct resolution for the primary monitor. In setups where you may use multiple different monitors (TV, PC Monitor, Moonlight Streaming), this can be a pain, as you need to go into the settings and change the in-game resolution manually. My solution to this, is developing this program that lets you swap out config files for games using a UI or CLI. This can then be further automated with a tool like AHK.

## Features
* Swap out config files using a UI or CLI.
* Create game profiles and store up to 2 profiles per game.

## TODO
* Implement unlimited profiles.
* Make UI pretty.
 ~~Create a json file if one is not present.~~
* Implement a feature that can swap variables within the config file with a value (good for changing resolution settings in a game's config file).
