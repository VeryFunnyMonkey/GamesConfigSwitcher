**GCS** is a tool designed to alleviate the hassle of manually adjusting in-game resolutions when switching between multiple monitors (e.g., TV, PC Monitor, Moonlight Streaming). Some games fail to automatically adjust the resolution to the correct monitor, forcing you to change settings manually. GCS solves this problem by allowing you to easily swap out game config files using either a graphical interface or the command line. You can further automate this process with tools like AutoHotkey (AHK).

## Features
- **Swap Config Files:** Easily switch between different config files using a UI or CLI.
- **Multiple Profiles:** Create and manage multiple game profiles for different use cases.

## Usage
_Both the CLI and UI share the same JSON file for storing game data, so you can switch between them seamlessly. The UI is primarily designed for adding and managing games, while the CLI is ideal for quickly applying profiles._

### Game Profile Structure
A game profile consists of the following:

  - **Game Title:** The name of the game.
  - **Config Path:** The path to the game's main config file. For example, for Skyrim, this would be:
    ```\users\username\My Documents\My Games\Skyrim\skyrimprefs.ini```
  - **Profiles:** - the file that will replace the file in the Config Path

### CLI
You can execute commands by running the binary in a terminal, using: 
```bash
.\gcs
```
To list out the commands, and see their usage, run:
```bash
.\gcs --help
```
#### Commands
#### Commands

- **Add**
  - **Description:** Adds a new game with its configuration path and profiles. You must have at least 1 profile, but can have as many profiles as you need.
  - Syntax
    ```bash
    .\gcs add -t "Game Title" -c "Game Config File" -p "<profileTitle profilePath>" -p "<profileTitle profilePath>"
    ```
  - **Usage Example:**
    ```bash
    .\gcs add -t "Skyrim" -c "\users\username\My Documents\My Games\Skyrim\skyrimprefs.ini" -p "Profile1 C:\Path\To\Profile1.ini" -p "Profile2 C:\Path\To\Profile2.ini"
    ```
  - **Explanation:** This command adds a game titled "Skyrim" with the given configuration path and two profiles: "Profile1" and "Profile2", each with its own path.

- **Delete**
  - **Description:** Deletes an existing game from the configuration.
  - Syntax
    ```bash
    .\gcs delete -t "Game Title"
    ```
  - **Usage Example:**
    ```bash
    .\gcs delete -t "Skyrim"
    ```
  - **Explanation:** This command deletes the game titled "Skyrim" from the configuration.

- **Edit**
  - **Description:** Edits an existing gameâ€™s title, configuration path, or profiles.
  - **Syntax:**
    ```bash
    .\gcs edit -o "Old Game Title" -t "New Title" -c "New Game Config Path" -p "NewProfileTitle NewProfilePath"
    ```
  - **Usage Example:**
    ```bash
    .\gcs edit -o "Skyrim" -t "Skyrim SE" -c "\users\username\My Documents\My Games\Skyrim Special Edition\skyrimprefs.ini" -p "Profile1 C:\Path\To\NewProfile1.ini"
    ```
  - **Explanation:** This command changes the title of "Skyrim" to "Skyrim SE", updates the configuration path, and edits "Profile1" with a new path.

- **List**
  - **Description:** Lists all games and their profiles along with the configuration paths.
  - **Syntax:**
    ```bash
    .\gcs list
    ```
  - **Usage Example:**
    ```bash
    .\gcs list
    ```
  - **Explanation:** This command lists all stored games, their configuration paths, and associated profiles.

- **Use**
  - **Description:** Copies the selected profile to the game's configuration path. [variables](#variables) are optional.
  - **Syntax:**
    ```bash
    .\gcs use -t "Game Title" -p "Profile Title" -v "variable:value"
    ```
  - **Usage Example:**
    ```bash
    .\gcs use -t "Skyrim" -p "Profile1" -v "x:3840" -v "y:2160"
    ```
  - **Explanation:** This command copies "Profile1" for "Skyrim" to its configuration path, replacing variables `x` and `y` with `3840` and `2160` respectively.

- **UseAll**
  - **Description:** Copies the matching profiles for all games to their respective configuration paths. [variables](#variables) are optional.
  - **Syntax:**
    ```bash
    .\gcs useall -p "Profile Title" -v "variable:value"
    ```
  - **Usage Example:**
    ```bash
    .\gcs useall -p "Profile1" -v "x:3840" -v "y:2160"
    ```
  - **Explanation:** This command copies "Profile1" for all games to their configuration paths, replacing variables `x` and `y` with `3840` and `2160` respectively.

#### Variables
_Currently only available in CLI_

When using the ```use``` or ```useall``` command, you can optionally pass in the ```--variable -v``` option to use the variables function.
It works by finding a variable within the profile file, and replacing it with whatever value is defined at runtime.
Variables are defined in the profile file using the following format: ```${variable}```
When the ```--variable -v``` option is used, you can define the name of the variable and the value in the following format: ```variable:value```

***Example:***
You want to dynamically set the resolution of the game to your TVs resolution.

In your profile, for this example let's call it "tv", the way the game defines the resolution is with an x & y value, it may look something like this: 
```
x: 1920
y: 1080
```
You would replace the values with a variable like so:
```
x: ${x}
y: ${y}
```
Then using the following command, you can set the games resolution at runtime:
```.\gcs use -t myGame -p tv -v x:3840 -v y:2160```
This will set the x & y value to 3840 & 2160 respectively.

### UI (Windows Only)
Running the file: ```GCS.UI.exe``` opens a basic UI that allows you to use game profiles, add new games, or edit the profile paths of games.

## Installation
GCS is portable and stores no appdata files. It only creates a gameData.json file in the directory the binary is executed.

### CLI Installation
1. Download the latest gcs binary from the releases, matching your operating system and architecture.
2. On Unix based systems, you may need to make the ```gcs``` binary executable, by running:
   ```bash
   chmod +x gcs
4. Run the ```gcs``` executable, use the ```--help``` option to see all available commands.

### UI Installation (Windows Only)
1. Download the latest GCS.UI zip file from the releases.
3. Extract the files and un the  ```GCS.UI.exe``` executable.

#### Locate the Binaries
   After publishing, the executables will be located in the ```./output/cli``` and ```./output/ui``` directories for the CLI and UI respectively.

#### Run the Application
   
   **- CLI:** Navigate to the ```./output/cli``` directory and run:
   ```bash
   ./gcs --help
   ```
   **- UI:** Navigate to the ./publish/ui directory and double-click the GCS.UI.exe file to launch the UI.

## Libraries and Dependencies
GCS relies on several libraries and packages to function. Below are the key libraries used:

- **[Cocona](https://github.com/mayuki/Cocona):** Used for handling command-line interface commands and arguments.
- **Newtonsoft.Json:** Used for handling JSON serialization and deserialization.
- **Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection:** Provides dependency injection capabilities for the application (currently only used in CLI).
- **WinForms:** Used for building the graphical user interface for the UI (Windows Only).

All necessary dependencies are restored automatically when you run `dotnet restore`. If you wish to explore or modify the dependencies, you can find them listed in the `.csproj` files of the respective projects.

## TODO
* ~~Implement unlimited profiles.~~
* Make UI pretty.
* ~~Create a json file if one is not present.~~
* ~~Implement a feature that can swap variables within the config file with a value (good for changing resolution settings in a game's config file).~~
* Eventually add the ability to have multiple different config files. This is not in the scope currently, but would be a nice to have in the future.
